A dumb tiny project that combines two words made in three lines of Python for the fair price of (FLASH SALE!!) **zero zembabwean dollars**.

I will do nothing if you show or use this anywhere without my consent, I literally don't care. I made this in like 5 minutes anyway, what are we even talking about?

Wondering why would one even get this. You can just, you know, use your mind...? It's not too hard to combine two words together without a silly wordplay involved, too...
